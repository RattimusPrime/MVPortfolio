		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>Besides being a halloween enthusiast, I either play video games and Dungeons and Dragons like most other nerds of my generation, Or I work on one of my bajillion art projects in one various form or another, and I am always looking for a new medium to explore with an artistic rabid insanity.
